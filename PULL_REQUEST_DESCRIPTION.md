# 🚀 Production-Ready Security & Deployment Fixes

## Overview

This PR implements critical security fixes and production deployment optimizations for the Lashed by Deedee booking system. The application is now **production-ready** with secure authentication, working email system, and comprehensive deployment support.

## 🔥 Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. **Security Vulnerabilities - FIXED** ⚠️ **URGENT**
- ❌ **BEFORE:** Hardcoded admin credentials (`deedee`/`admin123`) exposed in source code
- ✅ **AFTER:** Secure environment-based authentication with JWT tokens and HTTP-only cookies

### 2. **Email System Not Working - FIXED** 📧 **CRITICAL** 
- ❌ **BEFORE:** Emails only logged to console, customers never received confirmations
- ✅ **AFTER:** Production Zoho SMTP integration with fallback email sending

### 3. **Build Process Failing - FIXED** 🔧 **BLOCKER**
- ❌ **BEFORE:** Build crashed due to missing environment variables and deprecated Next.js config
- ✅ **AFTER:** Graceful environment handling with successful production builds

## ✨ New Features Added

### 🔐 **Secure Authentication System**
- JWT-based authentication with HTTP-only cookies
- Password hashing with SHA-256
- Automatic token expiration (24 hours)
- CSRF protection via SameSite cookies
- Authentication middleware on all admin routes

### 📧 **Production Email System**  
- Real email sending via Zoho SMTP in production
- Email logging in development mode
- Customer booking confirmations
- Admin booking notifications
- Automated appointment reminders
- Comprehensive email error handling

### 🛠️ **Deployment Infrastructure**
- Docker support with optimized Dockerfile
- Coolify deployment configuration
- GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline

## 🔧 Breaking Changes

### **Environment Variables Required:**
The application now requires these environment variables to function:

```bash
# Authentication (NEW - REQUIRED)
ADMIN_USERNAME=your-secure-username
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-secure-password
JWT_SECRET=your-64-character-jwt-secret

# Email Service (UPDATED - REQUIRED) 
ZOHO_EMAIL_USER=admin@yourdomain.com
ZOHO_EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-zoho-app-password

# Existing variables still required:
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-key
NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYSTACK_PUBLIC_KEY=your-paystack-public-key
PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY=your-paystack-secret-key
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://yourdomain.com
```

### **Admin Access Changed:**
- ❌ **OLD:** Hardcoded `deedee`/`admin123`
- ✅ **NEW:** Use your configured `ADMIN_USERNAME`/`ADMIN_PASSWORD`

## 📧 Email System Fix Details

### **Problem:**
After payment, customers were supposed to receive:
1. Customer booking confirmation email
2. Admin notification email  

But emails were only being logged to console, never actually sent.

### **Root Cause:**
The payment flow had two separate paths:
1. **Paystack Webhook** → Sends emails (when working)
2. **Payment Success Page** → Only verified payment, didn't send emails

If webhooks failed, no emails were sent.

### **Solution:**
- ✅ **Enhanced webhook route** with better error handling
- ✅ **Updated verify route** to send emails as backup
- ✅ **Dual email system** - webhook OR verify route sends emails
- ✅ **Production SMTP** via Zoho Mail integration
- ✅ **Comprehensive logging** for email debugging

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### **Before Deploying:**

1. **Test Build Process:**
```bash
npm install
npm run build  # Should complete successfully
```

2. **Set Environment Variables:**
   - Use `.env.example` as reference
   - Generate secure JWT secret: `openssl rand -base64 64`

3. **Test Locally:**
```bash
npm run dev
# Test admin login: http://localhost:3000/egusi
# Test health: http://localhost:3000/api/health  
# Test email config: http://localhost:3000/api/email-config
```

### **After Deploying:**

1. **Verify Health:**
   - `GET https://yourdomain.com/api/health`

2. **Test Admin Access:**
   - Login at: `https://yourdomain.com/egusi`
   - Use your configured admin credentials

3. **Test Complete Booking Flow:**
   - Make test booking with small amount
   - Verify emails are sent to both customer and admin
   - Check admin dashboard for new booking

4. **Check Email System:**
   - `GET https://yourdomain.com/api/email-config`
   - `GET https://yourdomain.com/api/test-email?email=your@email.com`
